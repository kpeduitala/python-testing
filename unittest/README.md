# Python Unittest Framework

## Description

Python's built-in `unittest` is a unit testing framework inspired by JUnit and has similar features as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

## Features

- **Test Cases**: Writing individual test cases to test specific functionalities.
- **Test Suites**: Grouping test cases into suites for comprehensive testing.
- **Test Fixtures**: Setup and teardown routines for preparing test environments and cleaning up afterward.
- **Test Runners**: Running tests with a customizable level of detail in test reports.

## Writing Tests

A basic test case using `unittest` is structured as follows:

```python
import unittest

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Code to set up test environment, executed before each test
        pass

    def test_something(self):
        # Actual test case
        self.assertEqual(True, True)

    def tearDown(self):
        # Code to clean up after the test, executed after each test
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In Python's unittest framework, **setUp** and **tearDown** are special methods that you can define in your test class. They are used for setting up and tearing down the environment before and after each test method, respectively. These methods are useful for repetitive tasks that need to occur around each test case.
setUp Method

### setUp

is called before each test method in the test class. It's typically used to set up a consistent state of the system (like initializing objects or setting up database connections) before each test is run.

### tearDown

is called after each test method in the test class. It's used to clean up the system state after a test method finishes, like closing database connections or cleaning up temporary files.

**Example:**

```python
import unittest
import tempfile
import os

class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        # Create a temporary file
        self.temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)

    def test_temp_file(self):
        # Test that the file was created
        self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(self.temp_file.name))

    def tearDown(self):
        # Remove the temporary file after the test
        os.remove(self.temp_file.name)
```

Here, **setUp** creates a temporary file, and **tearDown** removes it after each test method. This ensures that the file system is cleaned up, and no temporary files are left behind.

## Running Tests

The repository includes a basic "Hello World" python script and a unit test as an introduction to writing tests with `unittest`. The test verifies a simple function that returns the string "Hello, World!".

To run this test, execute:

```sh
python -m unittest test_hello_world
```
